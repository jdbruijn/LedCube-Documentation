Macros to evaluate an assertion and wrapper to print the output to the standard device.  


{\ttfamily \#include $<$assert.\+h$>$}\\*


\subsection{Detailed Description}
Macros to evaluate an assertion and wrapper to print the output to the standard device. 

If D\+E\+B\+U\+G is not defined the standard assert is used. Otherwise a custom assert is used which will halt the program and print the output of the assertion to the standard device. \begin{DoxyRefDesc}{Todo}
\item[\hyperlink{todo__todo000007}{Todo}]Rewrite macros and maybe there is an easier way to use the N\+D\+E\+B\+U\+G and D\+E\+B\+U\+G.. \end{DoxyRefDesc}
